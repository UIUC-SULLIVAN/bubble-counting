# bubble-counting

Author: Yi Liu, liuyifly@gmail.com.

This repository serves as part of my PhD research.  My PhD research is named as the thermal neutron detection with superheated droplet detectors. 

In the readout system of superheated droplet detectors, circular/elliptical object recogintion algorithms are required for bubble counting. Multiple different algorithms are inplemented here to achieve accurate circular object detection. The algorithms include:
  * Hough Transform (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform)
  * Curvature Analysis (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/16/9/007)
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Neural Network
